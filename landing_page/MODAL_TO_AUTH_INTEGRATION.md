# Modal to Auth Page Integration

## Overview
This feature allows users to fill out login/signup forms in the modal (alert) and have that data automatically transferred to the main auth page for completion.

## How It Works

### 1. User Flow
1. User clicks any button on the bridge-home (landing page)
2. Login/Signup modal appears (this behavior is preserved)
3. User fills out the form in the modal
4. Upon submission, the form data is stored and user is redirected to `/auth` page
5. The auth page pre-fills with the data from the modal
6. User can complete any additional fields and submit

### 2. Technical Implementation

#### Components Modified:
- **AuthModalContext** (`/context/AuthModalContext.tsx`)
  - Added `submitModalForm` function
  - Stores form data in sessionStorage
  - Redirects to auth page with appropriate mode

- **Auth Page** (`/app/auth/page.tsx`)
  - Reads data from sessionStorage when `fromModal=true`
  - Passes initial data to AuthenticationForm
  - Shows visual indicator when data was transferred

- **AuthenticationForm** (`/components/auth/AuthenticationForm.tsx`)
  - Accepts `initialData`, `initialMode`, and `initialUserType` props
  - Pre-fills form fields with modal data
  - Maintains all existing functionality

- **Main Page** (`/app/page.tsx`)
  - Uses `submitModalForm` instead of just showing alert
  - Preserves all existing modal trigger behavior

#### Data Flow:
```
Button Click → Modal Opens → User Fills Form → submitModalForm() → 
sessionStorage → Redirect to /auth → Read sessionStorage → 
Pre-fill Form → Clear sessionStorage
```

### 3. Data Structure
The modal passes this data structure:
```typescript
interface ModalAuthData {
  mode: 'signin' | 'signup'
  role: 'student' | 'employer' | 'institution'
  email: string
  password: string
  fullName?: string
  confirmPassword?: string
  remember?: boolean
}
```

### 4. URL Parameters
- `/auth?mode=login&fromModal=true` - Login mode from modal
- `/auth?mode=signup&fromModal=true` - Signup mode from modal

### 5. Visual Feedback
- Green indicator appears in top-left when data is successfully transferred
- Form fields are pre-filled with modal data
- User can see their information was preserved

## Benefits
- Seamless user experience
- No data loss between modal and main form
- Maintains existing button behavior
- Progressive enhancement of the auth flow
