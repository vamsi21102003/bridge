## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Frontend (React + Next.js + Tailwind CSS)
```
app/dashboard/student/feedback/
├── page.tsx                 # Main feedback page with CRUD operations
components/student/
├── FeedbackShowcase.tsx     # Featured stories showcase for dashboard
hooks/
├── useFeedback.ts          # Custom hook for feedback state management
lib/
├── feedback-api.ts         # Simulated backend API with CRUD operations
```

### Backend Simulation (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL Ready)
The current implementation uses a simulated backend with in-memory storage. The API structure is designed to be easily replaceable with actual PostgreSQL database operations.

#### API Endpoints Structure:
```typescript
// CRUD Operations
POST   /api/feedback          # Create new feedback
GET    /api/feedback          # Get all feedback
GET    /api/feedback/:id      # Get feedback by ID
PUT    /api/feedback/:id      # Update feedback
DELETE /api/feedback/:id      # Delete feedback

// Additional Operations
GET    /api/feedback/search?q=query    # Search feedback
GET    /api/feedback/filter?college=name # Filter by college
POST   /api/feedback/:id/like          # Like feedback
GET    /api/feedback/stats              # Get statistics
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Animations & Effects
- **Framer Motion**: Smooth page transitions and component animations
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive cards with scale and shadow effects
- **Loading States**: Beautiful loading animations and skeletons
- **Floating Elements**: Animated background elements for visual appeal
- **Staggered Animations**: Sequential loading of feedback cards
- **Micro-interactions**: Button hover effects and form interactions

### Design System
- **Color Scheme**: Blue to purple gradient theme matching BriDGe branding
- **Typography**: Modern font hierarchy with proper contrast
- **Spacing**: Consistent spacing using Tailwind CSS utilities
- **Components**: Reusable components with consistent styling
- **Icons**: Lucide React icons for consistent iconography

## 📱 Responsive Design
