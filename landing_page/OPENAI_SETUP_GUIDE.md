# 🤖 OpenAI Integration Setup Guide

## 🎯 Current Status
Your BriDGe AI Chatbot is **fully integrated** and working! It's currently running in **demo mode** because the OpenAI API key needs to be configured.

## 🔑 How to Enable Full AI Features

### Step 1: Get Your OpenAI API Key
1. Visit: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

### Step 2: Configure the API Key
1. Open the file: `landing_page/.env.local`
2. Replace this line:

   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```
   With your actual key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-api-key-here
   ```

### Step 3: Restart the Server
